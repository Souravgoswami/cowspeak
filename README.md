Note that this is only for GNU/Linux systems. It depends on `ruby`. Cowspeak recommends you to have `Ruby 2.4.0+`.

üíé This version is intended to run locally, without any root privileges. To run this version, download the repo as zip or clone it, and then run `cowspeak` (the source code) with ruby. If you want to install cowspeak for all users (as root), then follow the below instructions.

## For Debian/Linux Mint/Ubuntu/Kali Linux/Raspbian/Other debian based systems üêÑ

   1. Download the latest ![deb file](https://github.com/Souravgoswami/cowspeak-deb/tree/master/Deb).

      Cowspeak Debian edition releases can also be found [here](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1271477/).

   2. Install the deb file:
            `dpkg -i cowspeak-v<version>.deb`

```

## Note on Arguments üìù

You have to pass each argument separately. For example, cowspeak -rc rotates the colour of the output, and -w shows a welcome screen with some system status and information. So if you want to use both, you have to use cowspeak -rc -w (instead of cowspeak -rcw).

If you pass an invalid argument, cowspeak will not inform you. It will simply ignore the invalid argument so you can cheer!
